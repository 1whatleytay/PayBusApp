# PayBusApp

I guess the repo is just hosted here because, they were awesome teammates!

Made for [Urban Hacks 2018](https://uh.hackthehammer.com/), timestamped early grade 10.
The idea was as you walked onto the bus your phone would automatically detect that and pay the requested amount. 
It was actually a scrapped idea we had for our project for [TU20 Cup 2018](https://techundertwenty.com/tu20-cup-2018/) on late grade 9.
I used to have the project for TU20 Cup 2018 up but it had personal information of one of our team members so it was taken down :/

This was my first hackathon!
I used react native for this project, and I can't say I was really a fan at the time!
I think I just wasn't used to the node interpreter they were using, I was having lots of serialization issues that I had trouble figuring out.
Needless to say it was a stressful time, we didn't win this one but it got me used to the format and lots of other things.
